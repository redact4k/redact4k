- 👋 Hi, I’m @redact4k
- 👀 I’m interested in Frontend, and general CLI tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that are written in Python, Go, or Java/Kotlin
- 📫 The best way to reach me is via email (joseph@redact.is). It is still the best, and reliable public communication method even decades later.
